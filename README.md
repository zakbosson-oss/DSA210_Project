# DSA 210 Project: Competition & Niche Analysis For Youtube Channel


**Project Proposal: Background & Motivation**

   My name is Erim, I am a Senior Industrial Engineering student. The theme of my education has mainly been analysing, improving and if possible optimising systems or operations. I believe that there is a general assumption that what is learned in Industrial Engineering is only applicable in corporate or professional environments. However, I believe that the science that entails with the methods of Industrial Engineering can be applicable to smaller systems and projects. Recently I created a YouTube channel in the "Short Documentary" niche, more specifically the "WW2 Short Documentary" niche. At the moment, a heavy load of the work that must be done to publish videos everyday is done by AI: The script, title, description, search terms for images, tags, hook-comment and voiceover for each video are all generated by AI. What is left for me is to search and download the images, bring the voiceovers together and add titles (with the help of AI) and then publish the video to YouTube. From a very general and naive point of view, this pipeline is similar to a production line in a given factory and can be approached as problem where the objective is to maximize revenue (from YouTube) subject to views. However, trying to maximize views and RPM without knowing the parameters and constraints they are influenced by is similar to shooting at a target with a blindfold. The aim of this project is to get gather information about other channels in the "WW2 Short Documentary" niche and determine what the parameters that affect video performances are and what can be done to adjust them so that they maximize the objective. 

**Sources Of Data**

   Data for the research will be obtained from YouTube using various tools and methods. The primary tool will be YouTube Data API v3. Metadata such as title, description and duration will be able to be obtained with 100% reliability. Yt-dlp will be utilised to obtain data regarding thumbnails, tags and categories. Last but not least, Youtube Transcript Scraper will be used in order to get hold of the scripts in the videos without having to watch the full video and transcribing them one-by-one. 


**Data Processing** 

   Data will ve processed using python and libraries.



**Research Questions'**

   Due to the complexity of the problem that is trying to be solved, it is not sufficient to analyze the correlatiomn between one or even a few parameters. Instead studies with regard to multiple research questions must be carried out in order to formulate a model that can be implemented to the pipeline. I have formulated a set of research questions that I plan on researching. These research questions are subject to chnage at this point of the research (1/12/2025). 

**Hypothesis Set A — Thumbnail & Title Effects**
H1 — Videos with human faces in the thumbnail get more views.

H₀: Videos with faces have the same average views as videos without faces.

Test: Two-sample t-test or Mann–Whitney U test.

H2 — Thumbnail brightness is positively correlated with views.

H₀: Thumbnail brightness has no linear correlation with views.

Test: Pearson correlation (linear), Spearman (non-linear).

H3 — Videos with emotionally strong titles (“Hitler,” “D-Day,” “Nazi”) get more views.

H₀: No difference in views based on emotional/charged keywords.

Test: ANOVA (multi-group) or Chi-square for proportions.

**Hypothesis Set B — Topic & Content Structure**
H4 — Videos about major battles get significantly more views than other topics.

Topics:

battles

biographies

weapons

political history

maps/strategy

documentaries

H₀: Mean views are equal across all topic categories.

Test: ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis.

H5 — Videos with higher sentiment variability (emotional arc) perform better.

H₀: Sentiment arc does not influence views.

Test: Correlation + regression.

**Hypothesis Set C — Length, Upload Time & Channel Size**
H6 — Longer videos (20–40 mins) receive more total views.

H₀: Video length is not associated with views.

Test: Regression; also ANOVA (short/medium/long).

H7 — Upload time-of-day affects initial 7-day view growth.

H₀: View growth does not differ by upload hour.

Test: Kruskal–Wallis; time-series decomposition.

H8 — When controlling for channel size, thumbnail & title features explain most virality.

H₀: Channel size is the main predictor.

Test: Multiple linear regression or random forest feature importance.

**Hypothesis Set D — Engagement Ratios**
H9 — Videos with higher like-to-view ratio end up with higher long-term views.

H₀: Like-to-view ratio does not predict virality.

Test: Correlation + regression.

H10 — Comment density correlates with recommendation ranking.

H₀: Comments do not influence how often the video appears in recommendations.

Test: Spearman correlation.
